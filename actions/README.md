# Actions

The directory holds input configuration files for different actions
that shall be triggered using `hyperledger-updates` repository.
Changing the parameters in this section will affect the function of
GitHub actions, eventually affecting how `start-here-hyperledger` is served.

The current action files are generated assuming that the code is run
using [docker-compose.yaml](../docker/docker-compose.yaml) file.
